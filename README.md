<p>
This program automatically completes all the codingbat assignments in<br>
using answers provided in <a href="https://github.com/mirandaio/codingbat" target="_blank">this repo</a>.<br>
<br>
To use it, run Run.py or Run.java. They both do the same thing in different languages.<br>
<br>
When the program is running, <strong>DO NOT</strong> log into codingbat. Loggin in before or after<br>
the program runs is fine, but if you log in on a browser while the program is running, it will be interupted<br>
<br>
Because the program creates a new session cookie and associates it with your account, you will have<br>
to log back into any device you used codingbat after the program runs.

<p>
This program automatically completes all the codingbat assignments in
using answers provided in <a href="https://github.com/mirandaio/codingbat" target="_blank">this repo</a>.<br>
<br>
To use it, run Run.py or Run.java. They both do the same thing in different languages.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">DO NOT</span> log into codingbat while the program is running. Logging in before or after
the program runs is fine, but if you log in on a browser while the program is running, it will be interupted<br>
<br>
Because the program creates a new session cookie and associates it with your account, you will have
to log back into any device you used codingbat after the program runs.
